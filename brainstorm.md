### Pros of banking with Sparky
- All accounts are public, so you can flex your funds on your friends and strangers
- Profits go towards feeding animals (MeowMix/Friskies + Sparky)
- To withdraw, you must provide a reason to be reviewed by Sparky, keeping you from spending money on stupid things. Stop eating out when you should be saving for that new heated cat bed.
- Despoits, withdrawals and their descriptions are publicly visible; it's like venmo transactions, but for your entire life.
- Withdrawals must be voted on and approved by randos
- World's first FDIC insured bank (Friskies Deposit Insurance Company)
- Sparky isn't good at math, so you might end up with some extra funds (or less)
- Trustworthy; Sparky has never told a lie in his life, nor broken a promise
- Spend less, save more: Added inconvenience and gas cost to withdraw discourages impulse spending
